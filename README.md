Send SMS using Fast2SMS Python API
<p>
	This python script uses Fast2SMS services to send a SMS. To use this script, you need to first sign up at https://www.fast2sms.com and get your API key. Integrate the API key that you obtain from FAST2SMS in this script and you are all set to send your first SMS.
</p>
<p>
	FAST2SMS comes with two different types of API keys - Free and Paid. Free API key is the one which is used when you send a SMS from Fast2SMS website. Paid API key is the one used to send SMS directly from code or scripts.
</p>
<p>
	The task of sending Free SMS from your script instead of using the Fast2SMS website is handled in this script. Just put your API keys and run the script.
</p>
<p>
	SMS can be sent by calling the below function and passing mobile number and message as a list to the function.
	<pre>send_sms(['9999999999','Hello, how are you ?'])</pre>
